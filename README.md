# Foster-week8-homework

Before starting the project, I do feel that I have a general understanding of the basics of ktor and client / server coding.
I honestly don't have any open questions going into this, but I can say that this will be a good chance to see what I do and don't understand as well as I think I do,
as well as reinforce that information with some hands-on practice.
